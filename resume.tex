      \

I went on with ACI as a contractor on AHS project to introduce active-hotstandby cross-datacenter traffic switchover for production environment with over 300 peak tps

The project goal was to reduce customer-facing incident impact during major platform outages. In case of major incident in live processing datacenter, the automated solution is supposed to detect failure condition and switchover complete transaction processing to DR site.

  
          My particular responsibility was two-fold: 1) to implement tooling for controlled manual and automated switchovers, and 2)  monitoring solution coupled with rule engine, that would trigger switchover on particular predefined condition.
          
          The tooling was implemented in Go and consists of CLI interface for various platform components to orchestrate switchover across platform components, and witness daemon for proactive monitoring and incident detection.
          
          Part of witness daemon is a rule engine, that detects failure condition and performs automated failover if condition is met
          
          The tooling was designed to be clustered HA solution with safety measures to assist teams with DR exercises and gracefully handle maintenance windows
